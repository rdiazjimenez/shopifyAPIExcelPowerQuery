# shopifyAPIExcelPowerQuery
A case to query shopify GraphQL API with Excel


First attempt to query the API using GraphQL and Power Query in Excel.

Shopify API doesn't expose all the endpoints and you have to try different methods to retreive information that is close to the finance summary report.

Downsides:
As of posting this project, the cost retrieve is the current variant cost, not the cost recorded at time of sale.
Some small differences in gross sales have to be still reconciled.

Hope this helps other people trying to get information into their systems through Power Query
